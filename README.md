# p2p_messaging_network

We intend to work on a peer to peer messaging network. Every user will run their own
instance of an identical node, where they can send and receive messages. The messages will
be encrypted and will take a different path from the source node through the nodes to the target
node every iteration. The intermediary nodes, the message will travel along, will consist of
users, who volunteer to act as intermediaries. The goal of this is to create a secure
decentralised system for sending and transmitting messages via nodes.
We do not intend to create a GUI for this project because this application will be
interfaced with the command line. We intend to use C++ to build this, but we will revisit this
decision as needed when we begin implementing the decentralized messaging system. If we
have time, we may explore the feature to break up the messages into shards and reconstruct
the shards at the target node for added security. Other features and necessities will be created
throughout the process.
This project will take at least 40 hours for each person due to the complexity of creating
a peer to peer environment. There are multiple complicated components in making this type of
messaging system where each part has their own caveats. At the same time, testing will
become more complicated as we will require several active intermediary nodes during testing.
